# Spring 2015 Final Project for CSCI 2270 
##Part 1: 
######Project Summary:
This project uses information obtained on CU Boulder CS courses from Fall 2006 - Fall 2014 provided by the [Office of Planning, Budget, and Analysis](http://www.colorado.edu/pba/course/). Each unique course is stored in a hashtable using a hashSum function on the course number (e.g., 2270). Each course will have be a struct member with the following attributes:
+string for course title (most recent version of course title if more than one)
+vector of years offered in spring and corresponding array of instructors
+vector of years offered in fall and corresponding array of instructors
+boolean springOnly (true if 0 instances in fall)
+boolean fallOnly (true if 0 instances in spring)
+boolean moreSpring (true if ratio of spring/fall 


there will also be class methods to:
+search for a specific course and return information above
+search for springOnly and fallOnly courses
